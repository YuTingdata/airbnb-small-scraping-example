# Project : Webscraping with selenium

## Introduction

This small project aims to practice webscraping using python and the selenium library.
As a use-case, I will use the home page of airbnb.
Note that, due to regular changes in the website, the code provided may need to be updated, to reflect the changes.

## Prerequisites
### Basics
This repository is using python3, jupyter notebook, with pandas library.

### Selenium
``` 
pip install selenium
pip install webdrivermanager
# install the driver for firefox
webdrivermanager firefox --linkpath /usr/local/bin
```
